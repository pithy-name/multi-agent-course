# Agent Engineering Bootcamp: Developers Edition

Welcome to the official course repository for **Agent Engineering Bootcamp: Developers Edition**.

This repo contains all the code, notebooks, exercises, and project materials used throughout the course — a structured journey from deployment efficiency to validated, production-grade agentic systems. You'll master the full stack: the agent harness and ReAct orchestration, LLM optimization, hybrid memory (RAG + Knowledge Graphs), multi-agent coordination, and the evaluation discipline that proves it all works.

## How to Use This Repo

- Content is organized **module by module** under `modules/`, aligned with the live sessions and project milestones.
- **Google Colab Pro** is the preferred environment for the notebooks. You can also **clone locally** and run them in Jupyter or your IDE.
- Most notebooks include their own dependencies via `!pip install`; where a module needs more, a `requirements.txt` sits alongside it.

### Learn with Claude (AI tutor)

This repo is also set up to be **read and used with [Claude](https://claude.com/claude-code)** as a personal tutor. Drop the folder into Claude Code (or upload it to Claude.ai) and Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` to act as a patient, interactive guide through the course — teaching one concept at a time, checking your understanding, and tracking your progress in `progress/learner-progress.md`.

**Get started:** open the folder in Claude Code and type `/start`, or paste *"Read CLAUDE.md and run the `/start` onboarding"* into Claude.ai. Claude will greet you, ask how you like to learn, and begin Module 1.

**Slash commands**

- `/start` — onboard: pick a learning style and begin Module 1 (or the next one)
- `/progress` — see where you are, what's next, and any flagged weak spots

**Skills Claude auto-invokes** (in `.claude/skills/`) — just ask in plain language:

| Skill | What it does | Try saying |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| `teach-module` | Runs an interactive lesson for a module, one concept at a time | *"Teach me module 3"* |
| `quiz-me` | Quizzes you and tracks weak spots (never reveals answers first) | *"Quiz me on RAG"* |
| `explain-eli5` | Re-explains a concept as simply as possible, with analogies | *"Explain isolated context like I'm five"* |
| `build-along` | Guides you through a hands-on exercise step by step | *"Let's do the build-along for module 1"* |
| `warmup` | A ~15-min pre-class refresher: recaps the last module, previews the next | *"I have class soon — warm me up for module 2"* |

### Clone locally (optional)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamzafarooq/multi-agent-course.git
cd multi-agent-course
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Clone via Claude Code chat

You can clone this repo directly from the Claude Code chat interface without leaving your conversation:

1. Open [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) in your browser (or launch `claude` in your terminal)
2. In the chat, type:
   ```
   Clone https://github.com/hamzafarooq/multi-agent-course.git and open it
   ```
3. Claude will clone the repo into a directory of your choice, set up the project, and open it — ready for you to start learning.

From there, type `/start` to begin the AI-guided onboarding.

## Course Curriculum

> **The Agentic Systems Roadmap: From Efficiency to Action** — six modules across ~6 weeks, one 2-hour live session each. Every week ends with a working artifact you built yourself.

### Module 1 — The Agent Loop, ReAct & the Harness

Demystify what an agent actually is: the perceive → reason → act loop, the **ReAct** pattern, and what a production **harness** adds on top of a 50-line loop. Build a ReAct agent from scratch, no framework.

**Key topics:** the agent loop · ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) · agent vs. workflow vs. chatbot · debugging via the trace · agent frameworks (smolagents)

---

### Module 2 — Skills, Subagents & Multi-Agent Orchestration

Go from *one* agent doing one thing well to a *coordinated system* of agents. Learn why isolated context windows are the whole point, the orchestrator + subagents pattern, and how to define your own subagents — then watch the pattern run end to end in **Sprint Zero**.

**Key topics:** agents vs. subagents · isolated context windows · the orchestrator pattern (sequential vs. parallel) · defining subagents in `.claude/agents/` · specialization & the shared-spec coordination layer · multi-agent failure modes · the Sprint Zero capstone

**📦 Featured project: [Sprint Zero](#sprint-zero--a-multi-agent-product-team-in-your-terminal)** — the module's capstone: a multi-agent system that turns a product URL and three answers into six spec docs and a working full-stack app.


---

### Module 3 — Agentic RAG, Semantic Cache & Knowledge Graphs

Treat retrieval as a tool the agent *decides* to use — not a static bolt-on. Add a semantic cache for real latency/cost wins, and contrast vector RAG with Knowledge Graphs for structured reasoning.

**Key topics:** naive RAG vs. agentic RAG · query routing & multi-hop retrieval · semantic caching · Knowledge Graphs & GraphRAG · text-to-Cypher · RAG vs. KG evaluation


**📊 Featured project: RAG vs. Knowledge Graph comparison framework** — a Streamlit app that objectively compares RAG and KG approaches with LLM-based evaluation and interactive graph visualizations.
[View documentation →](modules/Module_3_Agentic_RAG/Knowledge_Graphs/README.md)

```bash
cd modules/Module_3_Agentic_RAG/Knowledge_Graphs
python setup.py      # one-time setup
streamlit run app.py
```

---

### Module 4 — Evaluation & Guardrails

Close the loop: ship with measurable quality and safety, not hope.

**Key topics:** input/output guardrails · prompt-injection & jailbreak defense (Llama Guard) · trajectory eval vs. outcome eval · LLM-as-judge (and how to validate the judge) · golden task sets


---

### Module 5 — Multi-Agent Systems (MCP · A2A · ADK)

When many agents beat one — and the more common case where they don't. Build a coordinated multi-agent system and learn the protocol layer underneath the marketing.

**Key topics:** one agent vs. many · topologies (orchestrator-worker, hierarchical, swarm, handoff) · **MCP** (tools), **A2A** (agent-to-agent), **ADK** (Google's framework) · shared memory & message passing



---

### Module 6 — Voice Agents & LLM Optimization

Ship an agent that talks — and survives real conversation — then make the inference behind it fast and cheap enough to run.

**Key topics:** the voice stack (STT → LLM → TTS) · turn-taking & end-of-turn detection · latency budgeting, streaming & barge-in · tool calling inside a voice loop · provider landscape (Deepgram, ElevenLabs, OpenAI Realtime, Vapi, Retell) · quantization (4-bit / 8-bit, FP4 vs. NF4) · KV caching · speculative decoding · inference metrics (TTFT, ITL, throughput)


---

## What You'll Build

This course goes beyond theory. Across the six modules you'll ship:

- An **optimized LLM deployment** with quantization, KV caching, and speculative decoding
- An **agentic RAG pipeline** with a semantic cache layer
- A **Knowledge Graph application** with a RAG-vs-KG evaluation framework
- A **ReAct agent** built from scratch
- A **voice agent** that handles real conversation
- A **multi-agent system** with ADK/A2A/MCP coordination
- An **evaluation + guardrail harness** that validates the whole stack

Each module includes hands-on projects you can showcase in your portfolio.
